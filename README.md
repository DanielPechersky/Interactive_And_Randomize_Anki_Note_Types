This deck is designed to make flashcard review a more active process, aiding in the learning of concepts that are difficult to distinguish (e.g., stalactite vs. stalagmite) and preventing rote memorization based on question shape rather than content. It uses randomization for each note type to help you recall information in real-life situations, not just in Anki.

# Match Pairs
Supports audio, images, and text. Items should be separated by the pipe operator (|). You can include more items on the back of the card than on the front to increase difficulty.
Use this note type to:
- Learn similar concepts that are hard to differentiate.
- Improve listening skills by recognizing minimal pairs. For example did the speaker say "tar" or "car".
- Practice [chunking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)) concepts together (e.g., bones of the hand, Balkan capitals, planets in the solar system).
- Recognize images (e.g., tortoise vs. turtle, radial bone vs. ulnar bone).

# Randomized Basic & Randomized Cloze
These note types let you write multiple questions about the same fact. Each time you encounter the note, a random question will be selected. Separate sentences with the pipe operator (|).
Examples:
- Who wrote The Hobbit | What is the name of the author of The Hobbit | Who was the author of The Hobbit?
- The complication with the highest mortality from measles is {{c1::pneumonia}} | Most fatal cases from measles result from {{c1::pneumonia}} | {{c1::Pneumonia}} is the deadliest complication from measles.

# Click Words
This cloze-style card provides possible choices to complete sentences, making grammar exercises more manageable. For instance, to practice the present continuous tense, you might have a sentence like "Today I am [...] tennis.". The issue with the sentence there are too many correct answers (playing, studying, done through) having choices provided to you (e.g., playing, played, plays) helps control the difficulty level.

# Shuffle Cloze

This cloze will show you cards with cloze selections randomly swapped. Example:

Symptoms of essential thrombocythemia are related to an increased risk of {{c1::bleeding}} and/or {{c2::thrombosis}}

It will show up either as

Symptoms of essential thrombocythemia are related to an increased risk of thrombosis and/or bleeding

OR

Symptoms of essential thrombocythemia are related to an increased risk of bleeding and/or thrombosis

# Sort Cards

In this note type you define categories and items that belong to these categories. Then you have to put each item in the right "bucket" - you need to match the items and the categories.

# Sequence

This note type helps you learn concepts that occur in a specific, ordered sequence. You are presented with a bank of elements (some correct, some distractors) that you need to drag and drop into the correct order.

Use this note type to:
- Learn sequential knowledge, such as the steps in **algorithms** or **biochemical pathways** (e.g., glycolysis, Krebs cycle, electron transport chain).
- Memorize **historical timelines** and the order of events (e.g., the events leading to WW1, Roman emperors).
- Understand **procedural steps** (e.g., scientific method, first aid protocols, cooking recipes).
- Practice **grammatical word order** in different languages.
